# ToDo

An open source todo app built with the purpose of testing out the new Next.js 13 features

## About

I plan on working on this project in the coming weeks and months and will be iteratively adding more features as Next.js 13 matures and libraries update.

Initially a simple to-do list app utilizing local storage will be built. Consequently the app will be improved until it is a fully viable authed todo list tracker with a database.

Ultimately, I want this to be a fast and responsive todolist app with a clean UI/UX. The interface will be strongly inspired by [Todoist's](https://todoist.com/) dark theme as they did a great job.
